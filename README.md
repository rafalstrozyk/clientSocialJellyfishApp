[SocialJellyfish](https://socialjellyfishapp.web.app/)

This app is twitter clone.

I relied heavily on this tutorial when building the application: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_u6P5k0vP0)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
